// Unfinished business

To fix:
- Fix scoreboard so it displays each player's gameScore after every turn
- Stop game from looping more than the desired number of players
- "Correct answer" message only shows for player 4
- Styling is hideous

To add:
- Loop game through 3 rounds
- Add leaderboard at the end of the three rounds
- More entries to the objectList
- Some way to stop repeat questions per game
- Create players as a class so only the necessary amount is pushed to the array
